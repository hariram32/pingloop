# pingloop
I made this simple little bash script during the hurricane Irma outages to monitor when my internet came back up. Extremely simple, but figured maybe someone else could use it at some point.

Just download the file, make the file executable, and run it in terminal with

./pingloop.sh

Use a text editor to change the site or ip address you wish to ping, and change the sleep timer to whatever interval you want.

Thanks!
